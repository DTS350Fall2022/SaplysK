I thought all of my visualizations came about in a pretty intuitive fashion, as they presented all the necessary information requested, and were visually subset to discern the various regions/cities of interest. In all of my visualizations, the idea of obtaining data that showed the prices and price movements of avocados over time in specific locations was at the forefront. All in all, based on the requested metrics, I believe that my visualizations help my friend make an informed decision on where he should move to and seek employment.
