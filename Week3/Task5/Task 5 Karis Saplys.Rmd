```{r importing data 1}
SoloData <- read_csv("solo-artist-followers.csv")
SoloData
str(SoloData)
```

Data imported correctly as characters.

```{r importing data 2}
BillboardData <- read_csv("billboard-hits.csv")
BillboardData
str("BillboardData")
```

Data imported correctly as characters.

```{r removing singers without 6 top 100 hits}
sixtop100hits <- BillboardData %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  filter(n() > 6, band != "")
sixtop100hits
```

Singers without 6 top 100 hits removed.

```{r finding bands}

sixtop100_bands <- BillboardData %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  filter(name %in% sixtop100hits$band)
sixtop100_bands
```

Corresponding data in the data set for the top singersâ€™ bands.

```{r}
ggplot(data = sixtop100hits, mapping=aes(x = peak_date, y = peak_rank, color = name, group = name)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(data = sixtop100_bands, color = "black") +
  geom_line(data = sixtop100_bands, color = "black", linetype = "dotted") +
  facet_wrap(~ band, scales = "free") +
  xlab("peak_date") + ylab("peak_rank") +
  theme_bw()
```

From the above plots, I can observe that in general, most bands experienced peak popularity between 2014 and 2019, with a few exceptions. Destiny's CHild seems to be among the most consistent, with periodic spikes likely corresponding to new releases of music.
