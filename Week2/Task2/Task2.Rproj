sin(pi/4)
```

using R as a calculator here in this case

```{r assignment operator}
x <- 10/3

```


```{r sequence}
MySequence <- seq(1,50, length.out = 7)
MySequence
```

sequence runs from 1 to 50, and contains 7 equally spaced out numbers

```{r vector}
my_vector <- c(1, 5, 12, 31, 19)
```

vector created using the compile/concatonate function

```{r determining result}
7+5==12
```

== asks whether the preceding statement is TRUE or FALSE

```{r or statement}
(7+4=12)|(5-4=1)
```
